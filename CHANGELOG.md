## [Unreleased]
### Changed

## [3.3.0-RC1] - 2023-01-04

been resolved (PR #100)

## [3.1.2] - 2021-04-22
### Changed
- Emails are now triggered via a single script, `jobs/Email.php` instead of calling`tutors/asessments/email/ClosingReminder.php` and `tutors/assessments/email/TriggerReminder.php` directly. 

### Removed
- Removed LDAP functionality and options as the implementation did not work.

### Security

- Change password hashing to use the native password_hash() function in PHP instead of MD5 hashing which is insecure

## [3.1.1] - 2020-10-02
### Fixed
- Remove LTIAuthenticator class as it is a duplicate of DBAuthenticator as should not be used (PR #77)

## [3.0.5] - 2019-11-08
### Fixed
- When using the LDAP integration, users logging in had their firstname, surname, and email address set to a blank value. This was due to code being added to the system that was specific to one insitution, rather than a generalised implementation. It has been fixed by reverting the LDAP authenticator to the same one as in version 2 (PR #59)

## [3.0.4] - 2019-10-18
### Fixed
- When viewing assessments in a module, if no assessment has been created the dropdown will display the years 1969/70. This has now been fixed to display the current academic year instead (PR #58)

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where the database connection was not being properly closed down, meaning subsequent database calls would always fail, even if the `$DB->open()` function was called as the old, closed connection would not be replaced or reinstantiated (PR #43)
